# Open Questions

- **Report and Credibility Platform**: How to create a public web platform for UAP reporting and analysis, the platform must allow users to create verified yet anonymous accounts, ensuring credibility while protecting identities? It should enable reporting of UAP news, sightings, and document releases, with all sources and evidence accessible to the public. Users must be able to verify, debunk, and peer-review posts, with a voting system to highlight the most credible content. Posts should be classified by clear tags such as "official document," "alleged hidden document," "ocular report," "speculation," and more, and the platform must strictly accept only physical, material, and scientifically verifiable submissions to maintain rigor and focus. Additionally, posts should be ranked based on criteria such as the number of verified official evidences, the volume and quality of peer reviews, and the overall credibility established by user interactions. Users can also earn a "verified specialty" badge that confirms their expertise in relevant fields such as astronomy, physics, journalism, photography, special effects, or others, adding weight to their contributions and reviews.

# Other sensor ideas:

Thermal Infrared Cameras: These cameras detect heat emissions and can capture temperature variations, helping to identify objects that may not be visible to the naked eye.

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): LiDAR uses laser pulses to measure distances and can provide detailed 3D mapping of objects and environments, useful for detecting UAPs in specific locations.

Acoustic Sensors: These sensors detect sound waves, including those from high-frequency or ultrasonic sources, which could help identify UAPs based on noise or vibrations they generate.

Optical Sensors: These include advanced photodetectors or specialized optical cameras that detect light beyond the visible spectrum, such as ultraviolet or infrared.

Magnetometers: These measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields, which may help detect anomalous objects or disturbances caused by UAPs.

Seismic Sensors: These sensors measure ground vibrations and could be useful in detecting UAPs that create seismic disturbances when interacting with the environment.

Gravimeters: These sensors measure gravitational forces and variations, which may help in detecting massive objects or changes in the local gravity field caused by UAPs.

Gas and Chemical Sensors: These sensors detect unusual atmospheric compositions or chemical signatures that may be associated with UAPs.

Radio Frequency (RF) Sensors: These sensors detect electromagnetic waves across a broad spectrum and can help monitor any unusual transmissions or disturbances associated with UAPs.

GPS and Motion Sensors: These can track the movement of UAPs with high precision, especially when combined with other sensors for better situational awareness.
