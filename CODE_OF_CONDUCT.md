# Code of Conduct for Open UAP - Data Capture and Analysis Project

## Purpose
This Code of Conduct is designed to foster a collaborative, respectful, and scientifically grounded community dedicated to exploring, documenting, and analyzing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) with integrity, transparency, and rigor. All members are expected to align with the principles of scientific inquiry, honesty, and respect for diverse perspectives.

## Core Values
1. **Scientific Integrity**: Uphold scientific standards by collecting, analyzing, and reporting data objectively. Data manipulation, bias, or falsification is strictly prohibited.
2. **Transparency and Honesty**: Share findings truthfully and fully disclose the methodologies and limitations of all research and observations.
3. **Respect for Evidence**: Conclusions and hypotheses should be evidence-based. Members are encouraged to question and refine theories, yet must respect the empirical process and avoid speculation without substantive data.
4. **Collaboration and Respect**: Encourage open dialogue, respect differing viewpoints, and recognize the contributions of all team members. Discrimination or harassment in any form will not be tolerated.
5. **Commitment to Accuracy**: All public communications, internal reports, and data representations must accurately reflect findings without embellishment or distortion.
6. **Intellectual Honesty**: Properly attribute ideas, data, and methods to their original sources. Acknowledge uncertainties, and do not claim unwarranted certainty or significance in the absence of sufficient data.
7. **Data Privacy and Security**: Handle all collected data with confidentiality and rigorously safeguard information as appropriate. Members must avoid sharing sensitive data unless authorized.

## Code Violations and Enforcement
Violations of this Code of Conduct undermine our mission and integrity. Any breach may result in warnings, suspension, or removal from the project, depending on the severity and circumstances. All members are encouraged to report unethical behavior, knowing that concerns will be addressed confidentially and with respect.
